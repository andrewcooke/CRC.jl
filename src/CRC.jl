# calculate crc checksums for data.  this process is closely related
# to the routines in IntModN (particularly GF2Poly), but the
# traditional implementations are optimized to the point where
# implementing them from "first principles" makes little sense
# (although we can use IntModN to check the results here).

# the basic idea is to do a polynomial division along the byte stream.
# it's all explained very nicely at
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation_of_cyclic_redundancy_checks
# and http://www.zlib.net/crc_v3.txt
